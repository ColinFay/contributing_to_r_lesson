A working camera and internet connection stable enough to transmit video are strongly preferred, if possible.

Part or all of this tutorial will be recorded and made available to the wider R community. By joining and remaining in the session you agree to have this tutorial recorded and the resulting video made publicly available.



## Docker and Rocker

For for the practical portions of this tutorial, participants will use use Eddebuetel and Boetiger's [rocker](https://www.rocker-project.org/) project to step into older versions of R to explore real bugs which have since been fixed.

**Prior to the start of the session** please have docker installed and the `rocker/r-ver:3.2.2` docker image pulled and tested.

Participants unable to run docker on the device they will be joining the session from will be placed within breakout groups where at a least one participant does have the setup working, and can share their screen, but working along locally is still preferable.
